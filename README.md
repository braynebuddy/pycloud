# pycloud
A word-cloud menu in Flask

pycloud is a Flask app that manages a collection of web bookmarks and presents it as a word cloud menu. Something like the old del.icio.us link-saving site used to do long ago (https://mashable.com/article/rip-delicious-bookmarking-site). It's based on an old tutorial example from a LAMP book I have long-since lost.

It's a small enough app to easily fit in Flask, and is a good first project for me to learn the framework. 

This is not very pythonic Python, but it makes sense to me!
